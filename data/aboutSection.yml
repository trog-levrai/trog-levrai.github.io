  ## About me

  My engineering mantra is KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
content: >
  ### Drive towards tackling real-world problems.

  I am a software engineer with a strong focus on data science and have worked
  on different topics such as mobility and remote sensing. During my university
  years, I have spent a lot of time getting my hands on all kinds of
  computer-related problems such as low level, cryptography, graph theory...
  Among those, I decided to get a specialization in data science. In the past,
  I've had the opportunity to work in France, Korea, and Germany, with very
  diverse people in multicultural teams. I consider it one of my biggest
  strengths.
