      #### Daimler

      **Data scientist** I researched and implemented speed and transition
      cost prediction models at city scale. I also deployed to production
      data pipelines on a K8S environment. Namely, I have deployed a ML workflow
      orchestration setup using Argo.

      #### Naver

      **Research engineer intern** I implemented a state of the art Q&A system
      using PyTorch. I also designed a caching system for a chit chat model
      using Elastic search in order to scale the model serving.
